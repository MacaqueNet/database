These terms may include citing related research, acknowledging funding sources or field teams, discussing potential co-authorship, etc. These usage terms are to be agreed solely between the data user and data contributor. Once an agreement is reached, we ask [data contributor] to send an email to MacaqueNet@gmail.com granting permission to share the requested dataset(s) with [data user]. We will then send the dataset to the data user. As outlined in our Terms of Use, the shared data must be used solely for the intended project for which access was granted. In addition to the agreed upon usage terms for individual datasets, any resulting papers using data from MacaqueNet should adhere to the citation guidelines stipulated in Annex I of the MacaqueNet terms of use.
