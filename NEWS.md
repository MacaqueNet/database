<!-- comment: track only changes relevant to data, not anything related to functions in the package...  -->
<!-- comment: add new entries at the top  -->
<!-- comment: this will go public on the website (no name dropping, please)  -->
<!-- comment: only increase version number of package if data content changed (and hence a news item is added)! (we thought this through)  -->
<!-- comment: but modify 'Date' in DESCRIPTION if changes to functions are made: version number is only a function/consequence of changes in data content!  -->
