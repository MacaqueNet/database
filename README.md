## What is MacaqueNet?

[MacaqueNet](https://macaquenet.github.io/) is a global grassroots network, whose mission is to encourage and facilitate collaboration between macaque researchers. Through cross-species comparative research, we can address questions that single-species studies cannot.
As part of this project we are building the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), standardised and collaborative [MacaqueNet database]([https://github.com/SPI-Birds/pipelines](https://macaquenet.github.io/database/), bringing together data owners and users. 
We always welcome [new projects](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfR3pvQBxVdw8PK0UhnTfzd2Ty85oLSY3HVHmApoq7s-n26Jg/viewform) using MacaqueNet data or [new data contributions and suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZYgh6GKW_CmiwbJu4KPil3OUEYgnB3ZUQjMhJ3XfZs2WPhw/viewform).

The documents of MacaqueNet are arranged in folders. Below you will find an overview of the documents that can be found in each of the folders.
