## What is MacaqueNet?

[MacaqueNet](https://macaquenet.github.io/) is a global grassroots network, whose mission is to encourage and facilitate collaboration between macaque researchers. Through cross-species comparative research, we can address questions that single-species studies cannot.
As part of this project we are building the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), standardised and collaborative [MacaqueNet database](https://macaquenet.github.io/database/), bringing together data owners and users. 
We always welcome [new projects](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfR3pvQBxVdw8PK0UhnTfzd2Ty85oLSY3HVHmApoq7s-n26Jg/viewform) using MacaqueNet data or [new data contributions and suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZYgh6GKW_CmiwbJu4KPil3OUEYgnB3ZUQjMhJ3XfZs2WPhw/viewform).

Below you will find an overview of the documents that can be found in this repository.

## Documents

### Workflow
The [workflow](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/MacaqueNet%20workflow.pdf) shows an overview of the steps from data contribution to data requests. The workflow folder also contains the [emails](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/MacaqueNet%20data%20request%20emails) that are sent out when MacaqueNet data is requested, as well as a [template for the format of social behavioral data contributions](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/MacaqueNet%20social%20behavioral%20data%20contribution%20template.xlsx) and an [overview of what happens when data is requested](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/What%20happens%20when%20a%20data%20user%20requests%20to%20use%20your%20data.pdf).

### Relational database

The MacaqueNet database is organised as a relational database. 
You can find an overview of all the tables that are part of the database, and how they are linked in the [relational database overview](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/relational%20database/MacaqueNet%20relational%20database%20scheme.pdf).
The [glossary](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/relational%20database/MacaqueNet%20Glossary.pdf) has definitions for each variable in the database.

### Terms of use

The [terms of use](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/MacaqueNet%20Terms%20of%20Use.pdf) document is designed to guide the use of data hosted at the MacaqueNet database. 
MacaqueNet data can be requested for academic, research, education, and other non-profit professional purposes. To facilitate data reuse whilst acknowledging data contributors, the document includes a data user agreement and guidelines for attribution.

### MacaqueNet collaborators

The [MacaqueNet research site acknowledgements](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/MacaqueNet%20collaborators/MacaqueNet%20research%20sites%20acknowledgments.Rmd) lists MacaqueNet collaborators with their current affiliations. We do our best to keep the affiliations up to date, but recommend checking acknowledgements before publishing.
The [MacaqueNet collaborators map](https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/MacaqueNet%20collaborators/MacaqueNet%20collaborator%20map.pdf) shows where current MacaqueNet collaborators are located, as well as the geographical range of wild macaques.
