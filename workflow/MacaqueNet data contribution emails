##Manual email sent by MacaqueNet Management team telling contributor if their data is suitable or not

Dear [data contributor],

Thank you for offering to contribute data to the MacaqueNet database! We are excited to welcome you as a new member of the MacaqueNet consortium. 

Based on your description in the form, 

##IF DATA APPROPRIATE:
we can confirm that your data would make a great contribution to the database!

We ask that you please send the data and accompanying metadata directly to us via email. As mentioned in our terms of use[ADD LINK: https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/MacaqueNet%20Terms%20of%20Use.pdf] , you and your team will remain the sole owners of the data once it is standardised and incorporated into the database.

I have attached a downloadable template which shows how your data can be formatted. Your data does not have to look exactly like this, but all behavioural data should be formatted in separate sociometric matrices for each behaviour. The accompanying metadata should include all data collection and subject information requested in the template.

Please refer to the following resources before sending your data:
 MacaqueNet workflow.pdf [ADD LINK: https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/MacaqueNet%20workflow.pdf]- overview of full process from data contribution, processing, storage in the database, to being requested by data users.
