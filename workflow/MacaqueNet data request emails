### Email template for establishing contact between data user & data contributor
To be sent to each data contributor (with data user in CC) for each dataset requested by a data user

Dear [data contributor] and [data user],

MacaqueNet’s mission is to encourage and facilitate collaboration between macaque researchers. Thank you both for being part of MacaqueNet!

You are receiving this email because [data user] has requested access to the following of your dataset(s) for their project entitled [project title]: 

-	[MacaqueNet ID], [population], [species], [study period], [behaviour], [extra info if needed]

The project proposal is: 
[project proposal]

This email is supposed to establish contact between the two of you as data user and data contributor. We ask that [data contributor] now replies to this email with their proposed usage terms (see MacaqueNet Terms of Use). These terms may include citing related research, acknowledging funding sources or field teams, discussing potential co-authorship, etc. These usage terms are to be agreed solely between the data user and data contributor. As outlined in our Terms of Use, the shared data must be used solely for the intended project for which access was granted. In addition to the agreed upon usage terms for individual datasets, any resulting papers using data from MacaqueNet should adhere to the citation guidelines stipulated in Annex I of the MacaqueNet terms of use.

Once an agreement is reached, we ask [data contributor] to send an email to MacaqueNet@gmail.com granting permission to share the requested dataset(s) with [data user]. We will then send the dataset to the data user.

Best wishes,
MacaqueNet

### Email template for sending requested data to data user 
To be sent to a data user when sending a requested dataset

Dear [data user],

Attached, you will find the requested MacaqueNet dataset(s) for which permission to share was granted for your project entitled [project title]. These data are to be used according to the usage terms agreed on with the respective data contributors of these datasets. To get started, the README file provides an overview of the folder contents, usage guidelines, and important information to help you use the data.

Note that these might not be all datasets requested for the project. 
If we obtain additional permissions to share datasets, you will receive another email containing all the approved datasets. 
This process is in place to ensure that all datasets are part of the same package version and are fully compatible.

As outlined in our Terms of Use, the shared data must be used solely for the intended project for which access was granted. In addition to the agreed upon usage terms for individual datasets, any resulting papers using data from MacaqueNet should adhere to the citation guidelines stipulated in Annex I of the MacaqueNet terms of use.
Please make sure to mention the package version [package version] when referring to the used datasets.

This project will now appear on the MacaqueNet website. 
Please let us know if you would like to make changes to the proposal or list additional team members to appear on the project's page.

Good luck with the project!

Best wishes,
MacaqueNet
