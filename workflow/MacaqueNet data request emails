Automated reply for data request Google form

Thank you for submitting your data request to MacaqueNet! We will now contact the data contributor(s) for the dataset(s) you requested access to, with you in CC to establish contact. This might take a few weeks so thank you for your patience! 

If you need to contact us in the meantime or if your request is on a short timeline then please don’t hesitate to email us at MacaqueNet@gmail.com.

We’ll be in touch again soon!

### Email template for establishing contact between data user & data contributor
To be sent to each data contributor (with data user(s) in CC) for each dataset requested by a data user

Dear [data contributor(s)] and [data user(s)],

MacaqueNet’s mission is to encourage and facilitate collaboration between macaque researchers. Thank you both for being part of MacaqueNet!

You are receiving this email because [data user] has requested access to the following of your dataset(s) for their project entitled [project title]: 

-	[MacaqueNet ID], [population], [species], [study period], [behaviour], [extra info if needed]

The project proposal is: 
[project proposal]

We are sending this email to establish contact between the data user[s] and data contributor[s]. To ensure consistency and comparability across requested datasets for this project, we ask that you please don't share your data directly and let us share the standardised dataset from the MacaqueNet database.

The [data user(s)] and [data contributor(s)] should now discuss the project to determine if the data is suitable and to agree on the terms of use for the data. This may include co-authorship, citing related research, or acknowledging funding sources or field teams (see section 4 of the Terms of Use for full details).
 
To begin negotiations, [lead data contributor], as the lead contact for these datasets, should respond to [data user(s)] with the following information:
  1. Do you and your team wish to be included as co-authors in any outputs of this project e.g. publications? If yes, please list the full names & affiliations for all proposed co-authors.
  2. Are the acknowledgements listed here correct for your research site(s)? If not, please list the appropriate acknowledgements below.
  3. Do you propose any other usage terms? If yes, please list them below.
  4. Do you agree that, if required by the journal, the derived metrics from the shared data (with scrambled subject names) will be deposited in a public repository (e.g., Dryad)?
 
[Data users] should consider these proposed usage terms and either accept the terms or discuss with the lead data contributor to clarify or negotiate the terms. 
Note that the MacaqueNet management team does not need to be cc’d in negotiation emails.

Once the data contributor(s) and data user(s) have agreed on the terms of using the dataset(s), we ask that [lead data contributor] sends an email to MacaqueNet@gmail.com granting permission to share the requested dataset(s) with [data user(s)], or letting us know that you do not wish to share your datasets for this study. 
Please aim to reply within two weeks, and if you anticipate needing more time, kindly inform us in advance. 
Once permission has been granted, the internal MacaqueNet team will send the dataset(s) to the data user. 

As outlined in our Terms of Use [ADD LINK to Terms of Use: https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/MacaqueNet%20Terms%20of%20Use.pdf], the shared data must be used solely for the intended project for which access was granted. In addition to the agreed upon usage terms for individual datasets, any resulting papers using data from MacaqueNet should adhere to the citation guidelines stipulated in Annex I of the MacaqueNet terms of use, which include adding MacaqueNet as a consortium co-author.
Data contributors can find more information about what happens when a data request is made here.[ADD LINK TO PDF: https://github.com/MacaqueNet/database/blob/main/workflow/What%20happens%20when%20a%20data%20user%20requests%20to%20use%20your%20data.pdf]

Best wishes,

MacaqueNet

### Email template for sending requested data to data user 
To be sent to a data user when sending a requested dataset

Dear [data user],

Attached, you will find the requested MacaqueNet dataset(s) for which permission to share was granted for your project entitled [project title]. These data are to be used according to the usage terms agreed on with the respective data contributors of these datasets. To get started, the README file provides an overview of the folder contents, usage guidelines, and important information to help you use the data.

Note that these might not be all datasets requested for the project [LIST ANY DATASETS REQUESTED THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED]. 
If we obtain additional permissions to share datasets, you will receive another email containing all the approved datasets. 
This process is in place to ensure that all datasets are part of the same package version and are fully compatible.

As outlined in our Terms of Use, the shared data must be used solely for the intended project for which access was granted. In addition to the agreed upon usage terms for individual datasets, any resulting papers using data from MacaqueNet should adhere to the citation guidelines stipulated in Annex I of the MacaqueNet terms of use.
Please make sure to mention the package version [package version] when referring to the used datasets.

This project will now appear on the MacaqueNet website. 
Please let us know if you would like to make changes to the proposal or list additional team members to appear on the project's page.

Good luck with the project!

Best wishes,
MacaqueNet
